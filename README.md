# Haukur - Text normalization for Icelandic

This text normalization toolkit can be used for the development of normalization grammars, and it contains a ready-to-use normalization application for Icelandic.
The normalization approach follows the idea of a two step process: classification and verbalization, as in Sparrowhawk (https://github.com/google/sparrowhawk). The implementation utilizes data structures and methods from Sparrowhawk's C++ code, but it is not a direct conversion. 

Haukur is designed for use in the Ossian TTS frontend library.
